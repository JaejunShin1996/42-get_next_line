"Philosophy is not a theory but an activity. 
A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. 
The result of philosophy is not a number of 'philosophical propositions', but to make propositions clear. 
Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, 
as it were, opaque and blurred." 
- Ludwig Wittgenstein
